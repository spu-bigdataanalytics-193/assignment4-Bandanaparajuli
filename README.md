In this assignment, first I uploaded the flights dataset in google drive. Then I mounted the drive in google colab.
Using the google colab i accesed the dataset for map reduce. Google Colab is faster way of doing map reduce.
I initialized the pyspark environment.I used pyspark to count the UniqueCarrier.

This objective of this assignmnet is same as we did in the last assignment . We have to use the map,shuffle and reduce to count the number 
of carriers.
In this assignment, first I uploaded the flights dataset in google drive. Then I mounted the drive in google colab.
Using the google colab i accesed the dataset for map reduce. Google Colab is faster way of doing map reduce.
I initialized the pyspark environment.I used pyspark to count the UniqueCarrier. Finally, I used the map reduce functions very similar to the last assignment.The difference is we cant use print function to get the results. I have used take function to read the outputdata.
